# SGAI - Outbreak
This is the repository that Beaverworks' SGAI 2022 will be using to understand
serious games and reinforcement learning. 


# This program would be much easier to make a machine learning model for as there is only one actor. 
In this game there is more simulation. But, we could still add many of our original features like the stun. 
It is also single actor so there is much less of a problem to add machine learning too.
It is a major change to the plans though so we might not want to do it.
